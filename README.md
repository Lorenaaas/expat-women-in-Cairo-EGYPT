- This page gives insight and helps women coming from outside Egypt have a reference point for information, gatherings and learning
- The scope of the project is to promote a safe place for expat women only to meet and spend quality time with other expats.
- I took on this project as I, myself, was an expat for 8 years in the Middle East and it was a real help to find other women in my same situation I could relate to.
